# YouTube Video Web Crawler
This is a small project that web crawls the youtube video link by the keyword and the integer you input.
  
## Small story :speech_balloon:
I love watching youtube videos and shorts.  
One day, I thought, maybe I can do some easy crawling things!  
So I decided to start writting the program.  
  
## Things you need to do :open_book:
* input a keyword you want to find on YouTube
* input a integer that this number is the count of the videos
* Install the library "selenium"
```
pip install selenium
```
* Install "chrome webdriver"  
Please go to [this webpage](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) to download
  
## What will you get :icecream:
You will get a bunch of links.  
You can open the index.py file using jupyter notebook.  
The link will be clickable after the program finishes.
